# Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Node.js and npm: JavaScript runtime and package manager.
Git: Version control system (optional if downloading directly from GitHub).
Installation
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

Clone the Repository (Optional if downloading from GitHub)

git clone [repository URL]
Alternatively, you can download the project as a zip file and extract it.

Navigate to the Project Directory

cd [project-directory]
Install Dependencies

npm install
This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

Start the Application

npm start
This will run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Running JSON Server (if applicable)
If your project uses json-server for a mock backend:

Install json-server Globally (if not already installed)

npm install -g json-server
Start the JSON Server

json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
Replace db.json with your database file. The server will run on http://localhost:3001.
